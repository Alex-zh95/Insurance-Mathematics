# Insurance Mathematics
 
 The main idea of this repository is to create a set of scripts/tools that can process and visualize the statistical/stochastic properties of given claims information, incoporating actuarial theories/techniques. 
 
 The raw functions can be found in the "backend" subfolder and there is some fake generated data available, which was used to check basic functionality. 

Several of the ideas have originated from various actuarial publications such as
- "Triangle-free reserving: a non-traditional framework for estimating reserves and reserve uncertainty" by Pietro Parodi, where a distributional approach was taken for evaluating IBNR
- "Pricing in General Insurance" by Pietro Parodi, which contains the theory of how Fourier transforms may be incorporated in producing a aggregate loss distribution when considering a frequency/severity approach to pricing
- "Schadenversicherungsmathematik" by Heinz-Willi Goelden, Klaus Th. Hess, Martin Morlock, Klaus D. Schmidt and Klaus J. Schr√∂ter in regards to Bayesian credibility techniques.
