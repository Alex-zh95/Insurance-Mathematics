# Insurance Mathematics
 
 The main idea of this repository is to create a set of scripts/tools that can process and visualize the statistical/stochastic properties of given claims information, incoporating actuarial theories/techniques. 
 
 The raw functions can be found in the "backend" subfolder and there is some fake generated data available, which was used to check basic functionality.
